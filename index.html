        <p>Hart-Celler refers to the two politicians principally responsible for the
        1965 Immigration and Nationality Act (the INA for short), Representative
        Emanuel Celler (D-NY), then Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and
        Democratic Senator Philip Hart of Michigan.</p>

        <p>For probably two years, I went by “Title 8” on Twitter; but was routinely
        accused of being a ‘bot’ or a Russian Troll—I’ll have you know my trolling
        is 100% American, despite English not being my first language and my reading,
        writing and speaking more than one, Worse, someone; an Immigration Attorney
        if I recall correctly, once suggested I was a poor (read: cheap) imitation
        of @CrimeADay, so I decided some fine-tuning of my brand was required.
        I’m vehemently opposed to the 1965 revision of the INA, primarily because
        of the long-term damage I think it’s done to the United States. Still,
        from a human-sounding standpoint, it was far better than the alternatives:</p>

          <li>Johnson-Reed, the Immigration Act of 1924;</li>
          <li>McCarran-Walter, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, amended
            by the Hart-Celler Act in 1965, and sounds like a bit character from Grumpy Old Men;</li>
          <li>Simpson-Mazzoli, the Immigration Control Act, better known as the 1986 amnesty;</li>
          <li>IIRA-IRA (pronounced Eye-IRA-IRA), the Illegal Immigration Reform
            and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.</li>

      <p>At this point, I should probably offer the following as a disclaimer:</p>

      <p class="oomph">I’m neither an attorney nor do I purport to be one!</p>
      <p>People often make the assumption I am, or have, but that’s not on me.
        What I am is a career civil servant who decided years ago the best defense
        to potential civil suits filed against me wasn’t to rely on professional
        liability insurance or depend on qualified immunity, it was to be as
        technically proficient as possible and in my mind, that required me to
        fastidiously study every aspect of immigration enforcement outlined Title 8
        of the U.S. Code, not just the parts I use on a day-to-day basis.</p>

      <p>I’m routinely accused of being racist and xenophobic. However, neither
        could be further from the truth primarily because Latino, which isn’t a
        ‘race,’ but an ethnicity, and originally from Central America. I don’t
        sweat such insults, recognizing the people who sling them are often
        virtue-signaling racists who, in a bid to feel better about themselves,
        think they need to white-knight, pun intended, for the poor “brown people”
        as if we’re incapable of verbally defending ourselves.</p>

      <p>Given what I do for a living and agitate about here in cyberspace, and
        that I’m a disciplined Operations Security (OPSEC) practitioner, I’m
        intensely protective about my true identity partly to protect against
        angry online mobs taking their anti-immigration enforcement ignorance to
        the street, threatening the safety of my family at home, and generally
        demanding my termination for faithfully upholding laws passed by successive
        Congresses. I’d say that there are perhaps no more than a dozen people
        know who know who I am. I like it that way, so please don’t take it personally,
        but no matter how nicely you ask or arrogantly demand I share my information,
        that of my supervisor, and/or agency (the latter ones probably sound at
        best exaggerated, and at worst entirely made-up, but I assure you, it’s
        happens, though thankfully, not often), I won’t, just as I never disclose
        my country of origin. Suffice to say since the 2000s, or in other words,
        through three Presidential administrations, I’ve enforced immigration
        following Honorable Discharge from the U.S. Marine Corps.</p>

      <p>Finally, I’d like to thank my friends for their support and encouragement,
        and friends, and acknowledge those who have asked me to start a newsletter,
        podcast, etc. To them, I’ll say let’s start with this and see how things go.</p>

      <p>For some, that I tweet and now blog anonymously serves as grounds to
        discount what I write, but to those who know me personally and Internet
        strangers willing to verify what I say about immigration law, the quality
        of my arguments and the citations I routinely provide speak for themselves.
        My wife regularly refers to my time spent on Twitter as a tremendous waste
        (both of my time and talent) and cites the adage about buying a cow when
        the milk’s given away for free. Still, while she suggested I start blogging,
        I’m never going to get rich from it, nor do I have any great desire to
        do so. I want to share what I know with those interested and willing to
        learn, and if those people threw a few bucks at me to keep this blog going,
        I wouldn’t say no.</p>
